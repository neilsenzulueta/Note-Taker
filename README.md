Module 11 Challenge: Express.js

## Description
  My inspiration for this project was to build an application that allows users to write and save notes. The app uses Express.js back end and will save and retrieve saved notes from JSON file.  Pls note that applications front end was already created.

  ## Installation
  Install Express.js, Insomnia App for debugging and testing, and Heroku platform used for application deployment.

  ## Usage
  User is presented with the main page of application. User needs to click 'Get Started' button then user will be directed to Notes page. The app displays the left column for saved notes and the right column for user input (new note title and the note's text).  Once user input is completed, a 'Save Note' and a 'Clear Note" button with appear on the top right of the page.  When 'Saved note' button is clicked, new note is saved and will appear on the left column. When saved note is clicked, that note will appear on the right column.  User can also delete saved note by clicking on the delete icon.
